# Card-Game
The first interactive app I've ever built, since I started my journey to become a Software Developer on December 2019. This app is just a little card game based on the Black Jack mechanics.

## Abstract 
This app was the first interactive thing I could built after taking a JS course. I decided to create this over-simplified version of Black Jack, in order to practice what I'd learn up until that point (I built this app on February 15th, 2020).

## Project Structure.
Since this is basically a super simple app, its structure is pretty straightfoward. The whole app is composed of an index html file, a css style sheet, and some JS code. If you want to take a look at this project, you just have to either download, or clone the repo and open the index.html file.
